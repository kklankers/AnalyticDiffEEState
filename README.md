# Description

Minimal (not) working example of calculating the analytic Jacobian of the End-Effector Kinematic State 
with respect to the Joint State.

The analytic Jacobian is not working correctly, there is a mistake in the linear acceleration part. 
All other values are correct. 

Maybe you need to adjust the path to the urdf model depending how you build the project.
